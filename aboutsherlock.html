<strong>Sherlock  Holmes</strong>
    <div>
     Sherlock a very interesting character indeed, as us look at an inside view of an intricate mind that works differently than others in an amazing way. People tend to not like him very much due to how different and "odd" he is. He is able to easily observe and deduct people and their lives as well as situations. He is a person who tends to get bored VERY EASILY, so never keep him bored unless you want havoc and a bunch of sass.

<strong>John Watson</strong>
    <div>
	 John Watson is a useful man. To Sherlock he is the closest thing to a friend he has. John is always up for an adventure with Sherlock(for who he cares a lot about) and living for the action and adrenaline. He keeps a blog on all the adventures he and Sherlock have been on, and it has gotten popular. John also had been married to Mary and had a child, sadly Mary had died in action is no longer around. Still living with Sherlock and taking care of his daughter life seems to be going okay for him.
